# Seize The Station - CLI Game

This command line interface game was created to fulfill lab 3 of Oakton's CSC 241 Java Data Structures, a class I took in the spring of 2021 while working towards a [General Programmer Certificate](https://catalog.oakton.edu/career-programs-pathways/computer-information-systems/general-programmer-certificate/). A description of the course can be found in [the Computer Information Systems course descriptions list](https://catalog.oakton.edu/course-descriptions/course-descriptions-discipline/cis/). In addition, the course syllabus and lab 3's pdf for CIS 227 can be found in the course_info folder of the repository. The starter code for this assignment can be found in lab 3's pdf. 

The command line game can be run at [this Replit link](https://replit.com/@john-albright/seize-the-station-cli-game).

The game relies solely on probability. There are three modes: easy (E), medium (M), and hard (H). The player has 20 rounds to get to the station. Each round, the player will travel a random amount of distance. On the way, the player may be met with an obstacle that lowers his or her health points (HP) and will not be able to move roward. On the fifth round, the player has a chance of uniting with a partner. If successful, the player will be able to travel more quickly to the station. If the player loses all of his or her available HP or does not reach the station in 20 rounds, the player loses.
